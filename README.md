# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
  For this project, I took in a raw csv file containing the names of different candidates. From this info, I used python to iterate through the data and display a final message containing the final outcomes of the ballot. 
 
### Purpose
  To familiarize oneelf with for loops, print functions, and f strings.

 ## Summary: 
This script can be used to determine which county populations deserve the most attention in elections because, ultimately; winning the majority populations wins the election. Even though this script provides a nice, simple summary, there's ways this could be developed. For starters, we could include data seperated by race, gender, ethnincity, and sexuality. This would allow candidates to better understand where their support is coming from and where its not. Furthermore, we could record popularity ratings throughout the beginning and end of the campaign to reflect how a campaigners popularity rises or drops throughout the election term.
